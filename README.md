# Summer Activites and Summer Travel Experience!
## 2 & 3
- My summer was quite boring! I spent most of my day sleeping in, sleeping late, and laying in bed. I also went back to school shopping, hung out with friends, spent time with family, and went swimming! I mostly enjoyed just being able to give my body a break and let myself relax before another stressful year of school.
- I did go on one trip this summer. I went to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico! I went for exactly one week and spent most of it relaxing by the pool and getting tan. I stayed there in a hotel and went swimming every day. What I enjoyed most was being able to be right on the beach, so my family and I would take walks on the sand some nights. We also spent 4th of July there, and our hotel did some fireworks. I loved spending time with my family, and being there felt so relaxing. One day, my dad and I went on a sushi date and ate lots of it. Since we go every other year, the next time I go will be when I am 17 turning 18.

# Future Aspirations!
## 4
- As I am getting older, I need to start thinking about my future. I need to think about what I want to become, and I need to take it seriously. Over the summer I started thinking about what I want to work as. I landed on becoming either a NICU nurse, or an ultrasound technician. Something I dislike about summer is how my routine gets messed up, and I lose a lot of motivation. I realize that although I feel drained once school is in session, I still love the hard work. I love what hard work feels like once paid off. I want to work hard to get money instead of it being handed to me. I am looking forward to my future and I think about it a lot. I am excited for after high school, where everything will then be working towards my career and making a life for myself, by myself.

# Goals for the School Year!
## 5
- My goals for the school year is simply, to thrive but work hard. I am taking 3 APs this year, so I know my work load is a lot. I have to learn how to take care of my health, while also prioritizing my work. I need to learn how to balance the two, because if I only focus on one, I know I will either lose motivation or become depressed. My overall goal is to end the second semester with all A's, and to pass all my APs with a minimum of 3. I also want to make new friends that will see me as a friend as well. I tend to stay with people even if they mistreat me, and I don't want to let that happen this year. I will not let other people step over me or make me feel bad about myself. I know my worth, and it is with people who will respect and care for me like how I do for them.
